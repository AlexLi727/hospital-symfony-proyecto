# Hospital Project

The idea of this project was to create a program that can be used by a hospital. In it, different nurses can register, log in, or perform various interactions with the database generated by Doctrine. It includes a set of basic functions that interact with the database through Doctrine:

| Function | Description |
| ------ | ------ | 
| [getAllNurses](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L19) | Connects to the database and displays all nurse data as a JSON response | 
| [nurseLogin](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L34) | Allows a nurse to attempt login using their credentials stored in the database | 
| [findByName](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L53) | Searches for a nurse in the database by name and returns all their details | 

These were the first ones to be developed. Once finished, we implemented CRUD technology, adding five more functions:

| Function | Description | 
| ------ | ------ | 
| [Index](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L72) | Similar to "getAllNurses"; retrieves and displays all nurse records |
| [New](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L86) | Allows you to add a new nurse to the database |
| [Show](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L100) | Searches for a nurse by their ID and displays their information |
| [Edit](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L114) | Enables modification of any nurse's data in the database |
| [Delete](https://github.com/Jonathancano2003/hospital-symfony-proyecto/blob/master/src/Controller/NurseController.php#L132) | Deletes a nurse from the database using their ID |
